# HeccyeahUi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.2 and Google's Firebase. We are planning to, in the future, use Ionic (https://ionicframework.com/) for mobile development and Electron (https://electronjs.org/) for native windows development.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running Deployment

Run 'ng build --prod' to create the prod build. Update the `dist\index.html` href tag to `<base href="/heccyeah-ui/">`. Run `firebase deploy`. Ensure it has deployed succesfully.
